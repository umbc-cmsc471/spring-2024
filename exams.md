This page will be updated shortly before the midterm and final exams to reflect what we actually covered this semester.

# Midterm exam

## <span style="color:blue">Reading Guide: </span>

(1) The exam will be based on the concepts, techniques and algorithms discussed in our text books (AIMI 4th edition) and in class.

(2) It's important to have read chapters 1-6 in our text. Specifically:

- 1.1-1.5
- 2.1-2.4
- 3.1-3.6
- 4.1 (not 4.2-4.5)
- 5.1-5.5, 5.7 (not 5.6)
- 6.1-6.4, 6.5.2

This will fill in some of the gaps in our class coverage and discussions and also provide more background knowledge.

(3) listed below are things you should be prepared to do.

### Chapter 1: Artificial Intelligence
Be familiar with the foundations, state of the art and both its risks and benefits.

### Chapter 2: Intelligent agents
Understand the basic frameworks and characteristics of environments and agents introduced in chapter 2.

### Chapters 3 and 4: Search

- Take a problem description and come up with a way to represent it as a search problem by developing a way to represent the states, actions, and recognize a goal state.
- Be able to analyze a state space to estimate the number of states, the 'branching factor' of its actions, etc.
- Know the properties that characterize a state space (finite, infinite, etc.) and algorithms that are used to find solutions (completeness, soundness, optimality, etc).
- Understand both uninformed and informed search algorithms including breadth first, depth first, best first, algorithm A, algorithm A*, iterative deepening, depth limited, bi-directional search, beam search, uniform cost search, etc.
- Understand local search algorithms including hill-climbing and its variants, simulate annealing and genetic algorithms, advantages and disadvantages.
<!-- Know how to simulate these algorithms. -->
- Be able to develop heuristic functions and tell which ones are admissible.
- Understand how to tell if one heuristic is more informed than another.

### Chapter 6: Constraint Satisfaction Problems

- Understand the basics of CSP, including variables, domains, constraints.
- Be able to take a problem description and set it up as a CSP problem. For example, identify a reasonable set of variables, indicate the domain of each, describe the constraints that must hold on variables or sets of variables.
- Understand the forward checking and ARC-3 algorithms and be able to simulate them.
- Understand the MRV and LCV algorithm and be able to simulate it.
- Understanding of Tree-Structured CSPs.

### Chapter 5: Adversarial search and Game theory

- Understand the basic characteristics of games
- Understand and be able to simulate Minimax with and without alpha-beta given a game tree and the values of the static evaluation function on the leaves.
- Be able to take a game and develop a representation for it and its moves and to describe a reasonable static evaluation function.
- Understand how to handle games with uncertainty.
- Understanding of MCTS algorithm
